## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  * The first point that had stuck out to me was in the article, and was about one's Zone of Proximal Development. I believe that it is always good for one to continue and push the boundaries of the ZPD in order to not just learn the material, but be able to learn new material on your own. This is something that allows one to continue to grow and further that zone to more difficult tasks. The second part was the mindset of opening up to learning, and allowing oneself to be open to discussion, and feedback, as well as knowing that there is always more for one to learn. These go hand in hand and personally made me think about the mindset that I put myself in in order to learn something, and how that can affect my process of learning. They briefly speak about this within the interview, but it resonated with how I personally look at situations, and my mindset towards them.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  * I believe that I demonstrate a Growth Mindset by knowing that I will need to continue to practice these subjects, and languages to grow and succeed as a programmer. This isn't something that can be looked at once and then used for every piece of code that one will write. I will see many different types of codes, and the more that I have practiced before-hand will allow me to keep learning and growing. I believe a way that I do not demonstrate a growth mindset is my willingness to ask questions to the group in order to complete certain tasks. Sometimes I will get stuck and spend a decent amount of time looking for answers to my question before I go to slack and ask anything about my issues. I think it is because I don't want to ask a question about a well known topic to everyone else, but to me it seems impossible.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  * `if work > time`
      `puts "Schedule more work time!"`

  * `elsif work > time || time = work`
       `puts "Begin working to have more free time!"`

  * `else work < time && work < free time`
        `puts "Set up a event for your free time!"`

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  * You would want to use a if statement to check if certain data inputs are either true or false. This used in our practice is to find out if certain variables are
  greater than others in order to print out responses according the the conditional statements being true or false. I could imagine a million reasons why you would in a work setting such as if one was looking for accounts over a certain balance, questions on websites, and for many different facets of using the internet.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

  * `if {condition is true}`
      // {do this}
    `end`

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  * In order to add multiple conditions to an if statement, one must simply use either a double `and` sign `&&`, or a OR operator `||`. These two operators are      
  meant to include two separate conditional statements, either choosing either one of them, or both of them when used in a `if` statement. This allows the combining of any two types of conditions in order to see if they are true.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  * `if {condition is true}`
      // {do this}
  * `elsif {condition is true}`
      // {do this}
  * `else {condition is true}`
      // {do this}
    `end`
