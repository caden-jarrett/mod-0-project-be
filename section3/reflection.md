## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  * The workflow this week was very directed, and had exact goals for each of my work blocks. Taking a smaller break every 25-30 mins allowed me to take a quick mental break, step out of my desk and get some water, go to the bathroom, or do whatever it is in that break time. I noticed that when I came back I was much more directed in whatever task it was I was completing. This allowed me to work effectively and efficiently to complete my tasks. I also noticed that I would sometimes work past 25-30 mins in favor of working closer to 45 mins and then taking a break for 5-10 minutes. This would often be done when nearly being finished with a certain task and just wanting to work through to finish it.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  * While using the Pomodoro technique's Step 1 and writing down the goals and intentions of each of my work blocks after coming back from my breaks. I often would refer back to these goals and intentions while working in the block as they would continue to direct me back to my original goal. Sometimes I would use the same tasks when working on the same topics after my breaks. For each time that I went back and didn't quite have the sections lessons or topics completed, I would set a new intention though each time that I came back from a break to the same section as I would have something new to do, but had the same goal that was originally set. This allowed me to be way more focused, and also less distracted when I would come back from my breaks. The time estimates would sometimes be working perfectly, but when unscheduled run ins with little screw ups and troubles made the projects take longer, but as this didn't happen often the timing techniques worked.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

  * A Hash is different from arrays as it allows you to set keys to the values that are within the Hash. Where as in an array you can only have multiple or no values, a Hash will require a key to also use for the values that are within it. This allows the user to pull either the keys or values when looking for the information within the Hash's where as you only had one layer of information within an array. This allows for users to find different methods of pulling multiple data points.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
  * `pet store = {dog_food: 5, cat_food: 8, fish_food: 15, dog_toys 8, cat_toys: 10}`

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  * `p states.fetch("IA")`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  * `p states.keys` for finding keys of `states`
  * `p states.values` for finding values of `states`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

  * A hash is better than an array and is used in order to have values that are tied to different values, and can be pulled either way through the key or value. This is much more efficient when creating data lists with more than one variable. This means you can now create data hashes including multiple peieces of information for on variable key. This allows users to pull very specific information for different keys.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  * When using an hash with possibly hundreds of of different variables and keys, can one list these in a more viewable way, or would one create more hashes to include the excess data?
  * Can hashes include endless key variable paired relationship's as in they can have multiple variables tied to a key, which show different data about each of the keys?
  * Would you be able to use hashes within if/elsif/else statements?
