# Section 3 - HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME, Arrays and Hashes

Section 3 is estimated to take a total of 6-10 hours to complete. Similar to the previous sections, this section of the project involves üìíreading, üë©üèª‚Äçüíªexercises, and üìùreflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline.

Since Arrays are a bigger topic, it is the main focus of this section. Some review work from the first two sections has been woven in so you get opportunities to continue seeing and applying those concepts as well.

- Hash
- key
- value

## Get Set Up

Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup. To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the project repository.

## Part A: How You Spend Your Time

One challenge developers face, more-so when they are starting out, is estimating how long something will take. Sometimes we don't account for merge conflicts, bugs, annoying Slack messages, and all the other things that interrupt our workflow or slow us down.

One challenge learners in a new environment/content area face is feeling like they know nothing, and until they know everything, they feel like they are failing.

So this week, we would like you to start self-monitoring your progress. Before you start on the technical work, reflect back on how the project has gone so far.

- Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?

  * The time estimates that I had set up in my calendar for the project have matched up pretty well for each of the sections of my project. There was only one section 2 exercise where the timing went past what I had originally thought would be necessary. This was the section on making our own little ruby game, but once I had the correct indentation it went by much quicker. I would say 90% of the time estimates that I had made ended up working out perfectly.

- When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?

  * When I sit down and begin my work, I often have a clear goal set out for what I want to accomplish in a set amount of time. I am often very aligned with the goals that I want to accomplish when I am working, and will set out sub goals within the work time in order to gauge the amount of time each of the different tasks take to complete. This is allowed by me setting up a clear goal when starting my work in order to complete the task in a timely manner. Sometimes I may get a bit side tracked when an issue or missing piece of a separate piece of the assignment isn't fully finished and gets popped up, and then I can get a bit messed up and off my work track.

- How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4 hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?

  * I work best using 2-4 hour blocks with 20-30 min breaks in between. This allows me to take a rest not just for my mind but my eyes. This is so that I do not get burnt out to quickly, and can continue working for a whole day if necessary, taking breaks whenever I begin to feel very burned out. I don't have an exact system in order to take breaks, but after finishing tedious projects or sections I will take a small break before moving on to the next one.

You've probably heard of the Pomodoro Technique in Mod 0 classes (and elsewhere, maybe!). During this final section of the project, we are going to ask that you follow this technique. Please read about it [here](https://www.dovico.com/blog/2020/08/26/the-pomodoro-technique-how-to-manage-your-work-time-and-flow-the-easy-way/).

The article doesn't mention writing down Step 1 (`Decide on the task to be performed`), but we ask that you find a special spot in your notebook where you do this for each work session. In the deliverables, we will ask that you share what you wrote down for Step 1 of the technique each time you started a new task.

_Note: if the 25 minutes on/3-5 minutes off isn't best for you, you do **not** have to follow that! The main focus of this is setting an intention and continuing to better understand your working style._

## Part B: Arrays and Hashes

Today you will learn about two common data types: Arrays and Hashes.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then push your work to GitHub.

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.
    - [ ] Read about what an [array](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex32.html) is from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [ ] Learn how arrays are [index-based](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex34.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [ ] [Hashes](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex39.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [ ] [Hashes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#8.-hashes) from Ruby in 100 minutes.

1. Work through the `arrays.rb` file in the section3/exercises directory.

1. Work through the `hashes.rb` file in the section3/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the `reflection.md` file in the section3 directory.

## Reflection

üìù Answer the questions in the `reflection.md` file in the `section3` directory.

## Commit Your Work in Git

When you are finished with all of the `section3` activities, use the Git workflow and commands you've learned to add and commit your work. Write a commit message that concisely summarizes what work this commit contains. Use your resources if you need a refresher on how to do this.

## Push to GitHub

Push your code to your remote repository. Visit your GitHub repository to verify the work you did for this section was pushed successfully!
