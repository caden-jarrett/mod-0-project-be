## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
    * I tend to wait too long to ask questions about certain issues that I am stuck on. Usually this is because of me believing that I have a simple fix and do not want to sound dumb, or un educated on the subject I am working on. I have recently tried to ask more questions, and I believe that once I come out of my shell I begin to ask alot of questions in order to truly understand the topics that are covered.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    * You would print the string `"Hello World!"` by typing `p "Hello World"` into your .rb file, and then ran in the terminal.

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
    * The octothorpe is the character that is used to add comments to the end of code following the end of the data type.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
    * The difference between a float and integer is that you would use a integer to declare a whole number variable.
        * e.x. years old = 22
    * The float however is used in order to make decimal numbers that can be used for finance or even percentages.
        * e.x. account balance = 1402.57

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
    * `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
    * You would print the variable y typing `p animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    * A interpolation is a string that can include multiple variables that have been defined previously.
    * `p "My favorite animal is a #{animal}.`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
    * The method to get input from a user is `gets` which allows the user input a line that is returned to your program.

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
    * `.strip` allows the user to remove white spaces around the code, to just show the code. 
    * `string.include?()` which allows the user to see if the string is included in another string.
